/*
Consensus Mechanisms :
  1.Consensus means coming to a general agreement. 
  2.Blockchain consensus typically means at least 51% of nodes are in agreement over the current global state of the network.

/*
Mining :-
  Mining is process of creating a block of transactions to be added to a blockchain.
*/

/*
proof-of-work mining algorithm :
  1.Take current blockâ€™s block header, add mempool transactions
  2.Append a nonce, starting at nonce = 0
  3.Hash data from #1 and #2
  4.Check hash versus target difficulty (provided by protocol)
  5.If hash < target, puzzle is solved! Get rewarded.
  6.Else, restart process from step #2, but increment nonce
*/

/*
Note : In proof-of-work, miners must present a proof (in the form of a hash output on valid input data) that they expended energy 
       in order to successfully "mine" a block and have it extend a blockchain.
*/


/*
Mempool :-
    The mempool is a place for miners to keep those transactions before adding them to a block.
    the miner will take all the transactions with the highest transaction fees from the mempool. 
    Then they'll add them to the block and attempt to find the proof of work.
